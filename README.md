Matlab functions for post-processing of protein stretching experiments

This repository contains Matlab code to analyse experiment files from optical tweezer experiments stretching and unfolding single protein molecules, followed by relaxing the force until refolding.
This is an improved version of the one in the repository "protein stretching". 
Main differences:
- Can automatically handle most changes in pulling velocity and sampling frequency.
- Does not require well-defined frequency of stretching and relaxing.
